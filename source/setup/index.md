I have an unhealthy obsession with other people's computer setups. I always find it fascinating to see what tools other people use to get their work done, usually in the hopes that I'll find something I didn't know about that can improve how I get my own work done.

Clearly I'm not the only one who finds this interesting, as ["some dude"][sd] created a site called [The Setup][setup] which contains interviews with people about the hardware and software in their setup. I'm not nearly significant enough to deserve an interview on that site, but I like the idea of documenting my setup, so I'm going to follow their format and write about my own setup. Ideally, I'll keep it up-to-date if things change about the tools I use.

## Hardware

On my desk at home sits a 27" Apple iMac from Summer 2010. It's basically my dream computer. There's a 27" Apple LED Cinema Display connected to it, giving me an absurd amount of resolution. In fact, it's probably more pixels than I actually need. I did not purchase the monitor outright, though I did obtain it through some interesting (and legitimate) means which I should probably write about sometime.

In front of the displays is a [Das Keyboard][das], my favorite keyboard of all time. For a mouse, I have two different devices: an [Apple Magic Trackpad][trackpad] for general use and a [Logitech Performance Mouse MX][mouse]. I really like using the trackpad most of the time, and I'm a huge fan of Apple's trackpads on laptops as well. However, I do a moderate amount of PC gaming, so I do need an actual mouse, and the Performance Mouse MX is a very good one. For sound, I used to use the built-in speakers on the iMac, and they're adequate, but that's about as generous as I can be. I'm currently using a set of [Logitech Z313][speakers] speakers, which a pretty good bargain and sound alright to my ears.

Since around July of 2006, I was using a MacBook Pro as my only computer. It served me well for many years, but in Fall 2010 Apple updated the MacBook Airs and made them actually reasonable for the price. I had been awaiting their update, so when the new ones were released, I bought one of the higher-end 11" models and retired my MacBook Pro. I love the MacBook Air. It's an incredibly well-designed machine, and the only thing that's wrong with it is it's out-of-date: it only has a Core 2 Duo processor, no Thunderbolt, and weaker graphics than newer Air models. That said, I still really enjoy using it, and I recommend them to just about everyone.

I suppose I should mention other "computers" I use. I have an iPhone 4S and an iPad 2. I really like both of these devices for just about the same reasons everyone else does. I considered upgrading my iPad when the new one was released, but honestly, this one's working well for me. As much I love Retina Displays (which is a lot), it was not worth the money to upgrade for me.

## Software

My OS of choice is Mac OS X Lion. It's the most advanced desktop OS out there: that's really all there is to it. I've been using OS X since Panther, and there's really no way I can see leaving it. I'm not sure I would enjoy working with computers as much as I do if I wasn't using Macs.

I use many different applications for many different purposes, so I think I'll break these down into more focused sections.

### General Use

I use [Chrome][] to browse the web. I was a big Safari user for a while, but recent versions have become so slow as to be unusable. Chrome remains quick and still pretty lean.

I use a wide variety of communication applications. For email, I use [Sparrow][] because it's fantastic. I can't stand using webmail interfaces, as much as I like Gmail, so Sparrow really is a dream come true for me. I get all the benefits and features of Gmail, but in a desktop client. For RSS feeds, I use [Google Reader][reader] through [Reeder][reeder], the best RSS reader I've ever seen. For Twitter, I use [Twitterrific][], but I've always been one to switch around on Twitter clients. At work, I use [Adium][] for Jabber chat. I actually prefer iChat in general, but it handles group chats poorly, so Adium it is.

### Productivity

I'm a big fan of software that makes me more productive. Maybe it's because I'm really good at being unproductive, so I need every ounce of help I can get from software. The big star in all of this is [OmniFocus][], the best GTD and task management app there is. I'm working on a detailed post about OmniFocus, but basically it has saved me from a lot of worry.

For automating repetitive tasks, I use both [Keyboard Maestro][km] and [TextExpander][te]. While Keyboard Maestro can accomplish most everything TextExpander does and more, but TextExpander is arguably better and easier to use for what it does. Another great automation utility is [Hazel][], which will watch folders and perform automatic actions one the items inside them. All of these apps have the quality that the more you use them, the more you start noticing new ways to use them. They get you in a mindset of automation where you start to realize how things you do can be made easier, and then you make it happen.
