I am Matt Moriarity, and this is my personal website.

**Academics:** In the fall of 2008, I enrolled at Georgia Institute of Technology to earn my B.S. in Computer Science. A number of semesters spent working have delayed my graduation, such that I am now planning to graduate in the spring of 2013.

**Professional:** Since the summer of 2009, I have worked at the Georgia Tech Research Institute as a software developer. In the past, I've worked with Java using Struts, Spring, and GWT and with JavaScript using ExtJS. Currently I work mostly as a database programmer using Oracle PL/SQL.

**Hobbies:** I enjoy programming in my free time when I can; I've been doing it since I was about 10 years old. Most of my hobby work now is for either iOS or the web using Ruby on Rails, though I am always interested in learning new languages and programming environments. I also play Magic: the Gathering and enjoy video games.
