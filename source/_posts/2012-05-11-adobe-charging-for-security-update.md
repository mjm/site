**Update**: Presumably due to the amount of notoriety it received for this, Adobe has decided to release an update to CS5 that includes the fixes for this vulnerability.

Adobe posted a [security bulletin][bull] earlier this week which describes vulnerabilities in Photoshop CS5 that, if exploited, would allow arbitrary code execution. There are no known attacks exploiting this vulnerability, so if this is now fixed, it's not a very big concern.

And it is fixed, but only in Photoshop CS6, a paid upgrade that was only just released.

It is completely unacceptable to charge your users $200 to prevent an attacker from executing code on their system. I find it hard to believe that Photoshop changed significantly enough between CS5 and CS6 that the same fixes applied to CS6 could not be backported to CS5. This is simply a case of Adobe exploiting their customers.
