The good folks at [Panic][] have announced [Coda 2][c2], a huge update to their fantastic web development application. Along with this announcement comes [Diet Coda][dc], where they have taken the idea of Coda, a comprehensive suite of web development tools packaged together, and applied it to the iPad.

Check it out if you do any amount of web development. As nice as Coda is, I don't own it because I don't do enough web site work to justify it. But Diet Coda will only be $9.99, at least at first, and at that price, I don't think I'll be able to resist. It looks fantastic!
