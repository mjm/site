[Bastion][] is currently 60% off [on Steam][steam]. It's an incredibly fun game that got attention for having a dynamic and reactive narrator describing your actions as you do them. Beyond that, it's beautiful action RPG with an excellent [soundtrack][].

It's certainly worth the $6 it's going for right now, but it's well worth the $15 it normally goes for if you miss the sale or just want to send a little more to support [Supergiant Games][sgg].
