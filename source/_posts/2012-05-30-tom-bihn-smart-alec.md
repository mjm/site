I've been wanting a new backpack for a little while now. I've been in college for four years, and I've been using the same backpack since before then. It has shown some wear, and it has accumulated quite a bit of cruft. I decided to look for a solid replacement, and basically every source I trust for recommendations spoke highly of the [Tom Bihn Smart Alec][sa].

I won't write an elaborate review of the Smart Alec because [Ben Brooks][bb] has already written a fantastic and elaborate [review][] for it already. I will comment on two little things about it that make me very happy.

I got my Smart Alec with a [Horizontal Brain Cell][bc] to hold my 11" MacBook Air. It turns out that the Brain Cell will also hold my iPad 2 next to the MacBook Air without making either very difficult to remove from the bag. The Brain Cell is fantastic: it is very well-padded but also rigid. I have no concerns about my laptop or iPad being damaged in any way while they are in this bag, no matter how badly I treat it. And the way the Brain Cell hooks into the bag keeps it in place as I move, so these items are never bouncing around while I walk. This was always a problem with my previous backpack.

The other thing I really like about the Smart Alec is how light it feels. Maybe I'm keeping less stuff in it than I did before, but I don't believe it's enough to account for the difference in weight that I feel. I'm inclined to give credit to the Brain Cell, which does not just sit in the backpack but is actually hooked in and suspended inside the bag. I believe this redistributes the weight to feel much lighter and more comfortable.

If you're in the market for a new backpack, and you feel like it's worth spending about $200 for a great one, you can't go wrong with a Smart Alec.
