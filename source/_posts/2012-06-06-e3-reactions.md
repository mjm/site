It's the second day of E3, and I've had a chance to see some of the things that have been shown off. I've definitely seen a few things I like, so I figured I'd note some of the games I'm most excited to see.

## Assassin's Creed 3

I haven't bought into the Assassin's Creed series. I played a bit of Assassin's Creed 2, but not much, and it didn't manage to pull me in. Watching the footage for Assassin's Creed 3, though, has me thinking that Ubisoft is going to be getting my money. The Revolutionary War setting is compelling, and is a nice departure from the previous settings. The combat looks incredibly fun and exciting. And don't even get me started on the [naval combat][naval]. Be sure to also watch the excellent [trailer][ac3trail].

## The Last of Us

The Last of Us is one of the most impressive survival game experiences that I've ever seen. The demo video I've embedded shows an experience that reminds me of the BioShock Infinite gameplay that I've seen and love. It's got an incredible character-driven story with a follower (Ellie) to help things along and add meaning. The AI of the enemies and Ellie really sells the survival atmosphere by reacting appropriately to the situations that you put them in. The result is an experience full of immersion, and that's what I want to see in game.

## Skyrim: Dawnguard

I played a stupid amount of Skyrim when it came out, and I'm actually starting to get back into it with all of the mods that are now available to give a different experience. So obviously I can't wait for some new official content! Dawnguard looks to be focused on vampires, which need some attention since being a vampire in vanilla Skyrim is just unexciting. Gameplay footage shows special vampire and werewolf perk trees, flying around while in vampire form, crossbow combat from horseback, and more fun stuff. The only downside to all of this is that it is Xbox 360-exclusive for a month. Otherwise, I'm thrilled for this coming out.
