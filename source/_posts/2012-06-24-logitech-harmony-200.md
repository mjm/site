Months ago, I lost the remote to my TV. Anytime I wanted to change the volume, I had to get off my lazy ass and hit the button on the TV. If this were a tweet, I would feel compelled to suffix it with "[#firstworldproblems][fwp]." Of course, the purpose of this post is not to complain about things that deserve no genuine complaint.

So I took myself down to Target today to finally replace the remote that is certainly in my room somewhere. When I finally found the section with universal remotes, I noticed that not only did they have the typical annoying remotes that I expected, but they also had a few different models of [Logitech Harmony remotes][harmony]. The cheapest one, the [Harmony 200][h200], was $20, and it seemed like it would fit my very basic needs, so I decided to give it a shot.

Harmony remotes are setup different than the average universal remote. Most universal remotes require you to try various codes corresponding to the brand of your device until you find the one that works. There is no flexibility: you get the mappings they have built-in and you can support only the devices the manufacturer thought to include (to be fair, this is typically pretty comprehensive, at least when the remote is new). They are annoying to say the least.

A Harmony remote, on the other hand, has a mini-USB port to connect the remote to your computer. You then visit a website, which loads a Silverlight plug-in to actually configure your remote. The configuration for your remote is stored online and synced to your remote when you connect it to your computer. To add a device, you simply type in the brand and model number for the device and an appropriate configuration is loaded. Nice and easy, just how it should be.

My TV setup is pretty simple: a Vizio HDTV connected to a second-generation Apple TV. I would have been satisfied just to be able to control my TV again from the couch, which of course the Harmony 200 handles just fine. When I was setting up the remote, though, I thought "perhaps this will also support the Apple TV" and entered it in as well. Indeed, Harmony remotes support the Apple TV very well. It actually did not work for me at first, but a little Googling made it clear that I had paired my Apple remote with the Apple TV, so of course the Harmony remote would not work until I undid that. Since then, it has been working great, and I'm now pleased to have only remote to care about that will take care of everything.

One of the best things about these remotes is that you can customize the button layouts at will. You choose which device the volume buttons control for each mode, and you can even remap extra buttons. For instance, I remapped a few other unused buttons for the Apple TV to be "Menu" so that they were easier to reach.

I was skeptical of what I would think of the remote's actual design, but I have to say I'm quite pleased with it. The shape is comfortable in the hand, and important buttons have distinctive shapes that makes them easy to find by feel. My one complaint about the buttons is that it is rather easy when attempting to press the "OK" button to also press in one of the directions around it. A minor complaint to be sure, but it's there.

I'm very satisfied with this purchase. The extra few bucks is worth it when it is something you use daily. Now I just need to make sure I don't lose this one.
