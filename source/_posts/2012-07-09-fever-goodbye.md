Lately, I've been trying to move myself away from Google products as it is feasible. I feel uncomfortable with how much of my information is kept with Google, but I'm not going to switch from services where the Google product is the clearly the superior one. Now the time has come where Google Reader is not a clearly superior product. Whereas previously, Google Reader was the de facto solution for syncing RSS feeds, a new contender has appeared: [Fever][].

In comparing Fever to Google Reader, I'll start off with the downsides to the transition:

* __Fever costs money__. $30 specifically. It's a one-time fee, which is a nice in a world where nearly all web-based services are either ad-supported or subscription-based (another notable exception is [Pinboard][], another service I really like). But it does cost money, and for some, that alone is a non-starter.
* __Fever does not have the same universal app support that Google Reader does__. [Reeder for iPhone][reeder] supports it, as does [Sunstroke][], an iPhone app specifically for Fever. Thankfully, for other platforms, the web application is quite good.
* __Fever is self-hosted__, which means it requires a server of your own to run it on and the technical skills to setup a PHP/MySQL application. If you already have these at your disposal, it's no big deal to install. If you're worried about paying for something that you might not even be able to install, don't. The Fever installer checks to make sure it will work before you purchase the license.

Now with that out of the way, let's talk about why Fever is better than Google Reader:

* __Fever is self-hosted__! Yes, I know I just listed that as a downside, but it is also an improvement once it's already set up. I'm in control of my own data. There is no need to worry what knowledge Google is deriving from the feeds I read. Now, I'm not the type to overly concerned with the information I give out, especially something as simple as my RSS feeds, but I do consider it a minor advantage.
* __The Hot List__. This is what makes Fever unique. Fever looks at your feeds, finds the most common links for a certain amount of time, and puts them in one list sorted by "temperature." This actually means that the more feeds you have, the easier time you'll have sorting out the most significant news. It's great.
* __Fever is very customizable__. And not in the "I have the source code, so I can do anything" kind of way, although there is that too. My favorite customization feature is that Fever will let you change the display options of any feed or group of feeds, including things like having some feeds display oldest to newest, having some show excerpts and some show full content, and having some show unread counts and others not. It goes a long way towards making your reading experience feel right for you.
* __Better sharing options__. Google Reader will let you share things to Google+, but that's about it. Fever has four customizable keyboard shortcuts for sharing to whatever service you like. Just give it a URL to hit, and it will be done.
* __The Fever webapp is very well-done__. It's just better than the Google one as far as I'm concerned, though I'm not the biggest fan of Google's style of webapps in the first place. The keyboard controls work well, and the app looks great. I always felt the need to use a desktop app over Google Reader. With Fever, I don't feel it's as important. Maybe that's just because there isn't one for it yet.

So there you have it. Fever is a solid replacement for Google Reader. If you feel like any of this might be worth having, I encourage you to check out [Fever][].
