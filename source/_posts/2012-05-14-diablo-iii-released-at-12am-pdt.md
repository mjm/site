A few weeks ago, I couldn't care less about [Diablo III][d3]. This was a rather shallow opinion: I had never played the previous two Diablo games, so I was just going on appearances. Many of my friends seemed really excited about it, though, so when an open beta became available for a weekend, I took the opportunity to try it out.

It was **so** fun.

I have no idea why. I can't explain why Diablo is so fun, because on the surface it's mostly just clicking enemies a whole lot. But the game makes you feel powerful and badass. It's legitimately fun and I'm legitimately excited for it.

Against my better judgment, I'm staying up until 3am to play when the game is released. Despite having class at 12pm. I'm pretty sure this is a bad idea, but I'm also pretty sure I'm not changing my mind.
