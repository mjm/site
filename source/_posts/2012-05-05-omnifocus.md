I am a forgetful person.

If I've got more than about two things that I need to remember to do, something is going to fall through the cracks. As you might expect, this can cause problems when people are counting on me to do things for them. Over the years, I've tried out many different ways of dealing with the things I have to do. When I've tried to use an actual organized system, it has inevitably ended up neglected and ignored.

<!--more-->

Usually the reason for abandoning my organization is one of two things:

* __Arrogance__: I start thinking that I'm smart enough to remember the stuff I have to do, so I don't need to write it down anywhere. This usually happens when my workload becomes lighter than it had been, luring me into a false sense of security.
* __Inconvenience__: Often times, it is simply too much hassle to record the things I have to do when I actually need to. This was typical of systems that were exclusive to the computer or web. If I was not at my computer, I wasn't able to record what I had to do.

Regardless of the reason, the outcome was the same: I had a system that was ostensibly supposed to show me everything I had to do but eventually always ended up inaccurate or out-of-date. It was abandoned.

This year, something happened to motivate me to deal with this problem. I assumed an executive role in [my fraternity][psiu], putting a slew of extra responsiblities on me. I was again in a situation where I had way more things to do than my stupid brain could handle. It gave me a feeling that I would not wish on anyone.

I was constantly __worried__.

At any given moment, I was always worried there was something I should be doing that I had forgotten. Even when I had free time, it was hard to enjoy it because I had no idea if should actually be doing something productive. It *sucked*. I decided I needed to get my act together, and I decided to do it with [OmniFocus][ofmac].

OmniFocus is an application [for Mac][ofmac], [iPhone][ofiphone], and [iPad][ofipad] that is heavily inspired by David Allen's [Getting Things Done][gtd]. It's not cheap, but it would be hard to put a price on how much better I feel _all the time_ from using it.

## Why does it work?

I've been using OmniFocus seriously for a few months, so it should be interesting to note why it hasn't been abandoned like all the other systems.
